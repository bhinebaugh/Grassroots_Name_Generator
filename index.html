	<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Buckley-v-Valeo">affirmed</a> that money is the same thing as speech,
		but it may be more effective to disguise the source of that speech somewhat (<a href="https://youtube.com/lastweektonight">astroturfing</a>). Provided you have
		plentiful amounts of money to spend and a commensurate quantity of political speech to express, this tool will help
		spread your message far and wide through the guise of as many independent expenditure organizations as needed.</p>
	<p>Note: With the proliferation of interest in democracy, some of the names generated may already be taken. We provide this tool as a public service and cannot vouch for the uniqueness or suitability of any names produced.</p>
