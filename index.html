	<h2>Grassroots Politics Made Easy</h2>
	<p>It is an incontrovertible truth (affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court) that money is the same things as speech,
		but the average person doesn't want to hear <em>you</em> talk all day. Provided you have
		plentiful amounts of money to spend and a commensurate quantity of political speech needing expression, this tool will help
		spread your message far and wide through the guise of as many independent expenditure organizations as needed.</p>
	<p>Note: With the proliferation of interest in democracy, some of the names generated may already be taken. We provide this tool as a public service and cannot vouch for the uniqueness or suitability of any names produced.</p>
